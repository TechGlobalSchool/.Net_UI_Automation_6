Selenium with JAVA
	TDD Framework: based on TestNG, Maven
			@Test, xml files, Maven Profiles, Maven Goals, Git, Jenkins

	BDD Framework: based on Cucumber, JUnit, Maven
			Runner, Tags, Maven Goal, Git, Jenkins


Selenium with C#
	TDD Framework: based on NUnit and .NET
		[Test], Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps = JIRA + Confluence + GitHub + Jenkins + more...





HOW TO SET UP A FRAMEWORK:
1. Programming language + IDE 	C# - Visual Studio
2. Build tool
3. Create a new project
4. Configure dependencies from Tools/Nuget Package Manager
	Selenium.WebDriver 3.141.0
	Selenium.Support 3.141.0
	Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver Latest version
	NUnit Latest version
	NUnit3TestAdapter Latest version


	Install the required software: To begin, you will need to install Visual Studio as your IDE (if not already installed). You can download it at https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

	1. Select .NET to build your automation framework.
	2. Create a new NUnit Test Project and give it a proper name like UIAutomationFramework or APIAutomationFramework.
	3. Link your repo with a remote repository.



5. Start automation!!!

TEST CASE 1:
Go to "https://techglobal-training.com/"
Validate the logo is displayed


TEST CASE 2:
Go to "https://techglobal-training.com/"
Validate the the "Practices" dropdown

using = import
namespace = package


BIGGEST DISADVANTAGE: There is no auto-import
You need to import all the packages you want to in your classes.



driver.manage().window().maximize();
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);



IMPROVEMENTS:
-Move setup and teardown actions in a base class and implement inheritance for better code reusability
-Centralize web elements using Page Object Model design pattern
-Utils: Driver, Waiter etc.
